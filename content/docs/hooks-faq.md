## 适应策略 {#adoption-strategy}

### 哪个版本的React包括Hooks？ {#which-versions-of-react-include-hooks}

从 16.8.0 开始，React 已经针对以下生态，包含稳定的React Hooks实现：

- React DOM
- React DOM Server
- React Test Renderer
- React Shallow Renderer

请注意，**要启用Hook，所有 React 包都需要为 16.8.0 或更高版本**。如果您忘记更新（例如，React DOM），Hooks 将无法工作。

React Native 将在下一个稳定版本中完全支持 Hooks。

### 我是否需要重写所有 class 组件？ {#do-i-need-to-rewrite-all-my-class-components}

不需要，我们 [没有计划](https://zh-hans.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#gradual-adoption-strategy) 在 React 中删除 Class —— 我们都需要保持出货的产品（ keep shipping products ），不可能承受重写的成本。我们建议你在新代码中尝试使用Hook。

### 我能用 Hooks 做什么 class做不到的事情？{#what-can-i-do-with-hooks-that-i-couldnt-with-classes}

Hooks 提供了一种强大而富有表现力的新方法，可以在组件之间重用功能。[“建立自己的钩子”](https://zh-hans.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) 提供了可能的一瞥。React核心团队成员 [撰写的这篇文章](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889) 深入探讨了 Hooks 所解锁的新功能。

### 我的现有React知识中有多少能保持相关性？{#how-much-of-my-react-knowledge-stays-relevant}

Hooks给你提供了一种更加直接使用 React 相关功能——例如 state，生命周期，context 和 ref 的方式。但它们并没有从根本上改变 React 的工作方式，因此你对组件，props 和自上而下数据流的了解也同样重要。

Hooks 确实有自己的学习曲线。如果本文档中缺少某些内容，请[提出issue](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new)，我们会尽力提供帮助。

### 我应该使用 Hooks，classes 还是两者兼而有之？ {#should-i-use-hooks-classes-or-a-mix-of-both}

当你准备好了，我们鼓励你开始尝试在你新组件中使用Hooks。请确保团队中的每个人都使用它们并熟悉本文档。我们不建议将现有 Class 重写为 Hooks，除非你计划重写它们（例如修复 bugs）。

你不能在类组件*中*使用 Hooks ，但你绝对可以在一棵组件树中将 class 组件和使用 Hooks 的函数组件混合在一起。无论一个组件是 class 还是使用 Hook 的函数，这只是该组件的实现细节。当然从长远来看，我们希望 Hooks 成为人们编写 React 组件的主要方式。

### Hooks涵盖了Class的所有用例吗？{#do-hooks-cover-all-use-cases-for-classes}

我们的目标是让Hooks尽快涵盖Class的所有用例。对于不常见`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`和`componentDidCatch`生命周期目前还没有对应的Hook，但我们计划会很快添加上。

对于Hook来说，现在还是一个非常早的时期，因此，在当下某些第三方库可能与Hook不兼容。

### Hooks会替换render props和高阶组件吗？ {#do-hooks-replace-render-props-and-higher-order-components}

通常，render props 和高阶组件只渲染一个 children。我们认为使用 Hooks 实现这种用例将会更加简单。就目前而言，这两种模式仍然有其立足之地（例如，虚拟滚动组件可能具有`renderItem`prop，或者可视容器组件可能具有其自己的 DOM 结构）。但在大多数情况下，使用Hooks就足够了，它可以帮助你减少组件树中的嵌套。

### Hook对流行框架的API来说意味着什么（Redux的`connect()`和React Router等）？ {#what-do-hooks-mean-for-popular-apis-like-redux-connect-and-react-router}

首先，你还可以继续像以往一样使用这些API，没有任何影响。（毕竟函数组件和Class组件本质上没太多区别）

其次，在未来这些库的新版本也可能导出自定义Hook，例如，`useRedux()`或者`useRouter()`允许你使用相同的功能而不需要包装器组件。

### Hooks可以使用静态类型吗？ {#do-hooks-work-with-static-typing}

Hooks 的设计考虑了静态类型。因为它们是函数，所以它们比高阶组件之类的模式更容易正确键入。最新的 Flow 和 TypeScript 已经包含 React Hooks 的定义。

重要的是，如果你想以某种方式更严格地键入React API，则可以考虑使用自定义 Hook，它可以让你有权限制React API。React 为你提供了原语，但你可以采用与我们提供的开箱即用方式所不同的方式将它们组合在一起。

### 如何测试使用Hooks的组件？ {#how-to-test-components-that-use-hooks}

从React的角度来看，使用Hooks的组件也只是一个普通的组件。如果你的测试解决方案不依赖于React内部，则测试使用了Hooks的组件应与你正常测试组件的方式相同。

例如，假设我们有这个计数器组件：

```js
function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

我们将使用 React DOM 进行测试。为了确保行为与浏览器中发生的行为相匹配，我们将代码的渲染和更新包装进 [`ReactTestUtils.act()`](https://zh-hans.reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html#act) 调用：

```js{3,20-22,29-31}
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { act } from 'react-dom/test-utils';
import Counter from './Counter';

let container;

beforeEach(() => {
  container = document.createElement('div');
  document.body.appendChild(container);
});

afterEach(() => {
  document.body.removeChild(container);
  container = null;
});

it('can render and update a counter', () => {
  // Test first render and effect
  act(() => {
    ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, container);
  });
  const button = container.querySelector('button');
  const label = container.querySelector('p');
  expect(label.textContent).toBe('You clicked 0 times');
  expect(document.title).toBe('You clicked 0 times');

  // Test second render and effect
  act(() => {
    button.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('click', {bubbles: true}));
  });
  expect(label.textContent).toBe('You clicked 1 times');
  expect(document.title).toBe('You clicked 1 times');
});
```

`act() `的调用也将刷新它们内部的 effects。

如果你需要测试自定义Hook，可以通过在测试中创建一个组件并使用自定义Hook来实现。然后，你就可以测试你所编写的组件。

为了减少样板，我们建议使用 [`react-testing-library`](https://git.io/react-testing-library) ，这个库旨在鼓励为你的组件编写测试。它们会像呈现给最终用户那样被测试。

### [lint规则](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)究竟强制执行了什么？{#what-exactly-do-the-lint-rules-enforce}

我们提供了一个 [ESLint插件](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)，它强制执行 [Hooks规则](/docs/hooks-rules.html) 以避免错误。它假设任何以“ `use`” 开头的函数和紧跟在它之后的大写字母是一个 Hook。我们认识到这种启发式方法并不完美，可能存在一些误报，但如果没有整个生态系统的约定，就没有办法让Hooks 良好的运作 —— 更长的名字会阻止人们采用 Hooks 或遵循其惯例。

特别是，该规则强制执行：

- 对 Hooks 的调用要么在*Pascal*命名法（PascalCase）的函数内部（假设是一个组件），要么是另一个`useSomething`函数（假定为自定义Hook）。
- 在每个渲染上以相同的顺序调用 Hook。

还有一些启发式方法，它们可能会随着时间的推移而改变，因为我们会对规则进行微调以寻求在发现错误和避免误报之间的平衡

## From Classes to Hooks {#from-classes-to-hooks}

### How do lifecycle methods correspond to Hooks? {#how-do-lifecycle-methods-correspond-to-hooks}

* `constructor`: Function components don't need a constructor. You can initialize the state in the [`useState`](/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) call. If computing the initial state is expensive, you can pass a function to `useState`.

* `getDerivedStateFromProps`: Schedule an update [while rendering](#how-do-i-implement-getderivedstatefromprops) instead.

* `shouldComponentUpdate`: See `React.memo` [below](#how-do-i-implement-shouldcomponentupdate).

* `render`: This is the function component body itself.

* `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`: The [`useEffect` Hook](/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect) can express all combinations of these (including [less](#can-i-skip-an-effect-on-updates) [common](#can-i-run-an-effect-only-on-updates) cases).

* `componentDidCatch` and `getDerivedStateFromError`: There are no Hook equivalents for these methods yet, but they will be added soon.

### How can I do data fetching with Hooks?

Here is a [small demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/jvvkoo8pq3) to get you started. To learn more, check out [this article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data/) about data fetching with Hooks.

### Is there something like instance variables? {#is-there-something-like-instance-variables}

Yes! The [`useRef()`](/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref) Hook isn't just for DOM refs. The "ref" object is a generic container whose `current` property is mutable and can hold any value, similar to an instance property on a class.

You can write to it from inside `useEffect`:

```js{2,8}
function Timer() {
  const intervalRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      // ...
    });
    intervalRef.current = id;
    return () => {
      clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
    };
  });

  // ...
}
```

If we just wanted to set an interval, we wouldn't need the ref (`id` could be local to the effect), but it's useful if we want to clear the interval from an event handler:

```js{3}
  // ...
  function handleCancelClick() {
    clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
  }
  // ...
```

Conceptually, you can think of refs as similar to instance variables in a class. Unless you're doing [lazy initialization](#how-to-create-expensive-objects-lazily), avoid setting refs during rendering -- this can lead to surprising behavior. Instead, typically you want to modify refs in event handlers and effects.

### Should I use one or many state variables? {#should-i-use-one-or-many-state-variables}

If you're coming from classes, you might be tempted to always call `useState()` once and put all state into a single object. You can do it if you'd like. Here is an example of a component that follows the mouse movement. We keep its position and size in the local state:

```js
function Box() {
  const [state, setState] = useState({ left: 0, top: 0, width: 100, height: 100 });
  // ...
}
```

Now let's say we want to write some logic that changes `left` and `top` when the user moves their mouse. Note how we have to merge these fields into the previous state object manually:

```js{4,5}
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleWindowMouseMove(e) {
      // Spreading "...state" ensures we don't "lose" width and height
      setState(state => ({ ...state, left: e.pageX, top: e.pageY }));
    }
    // Note: this implementation is a bit simplified
    window.addEventListener('mousemove', handleWindowMouseMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleWindowMouseMove);
  }, []);
  // ...
```

This is because when we update a state variable, we *replace* its value. This is different from `this.setState` in a class, which *merges* the updated fields into the object.

If you miss automatic merging, you can write a custom `useLegacyState` Hook that merges object state updates. However, instead **we recommend to split state into multiple state variables based on which values tend to change together.**

For example, we could split our component state into `position` and `size` objects, and always replace the `position` with no need for merging:

```js{2,7}
function Box() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ left: 0, top: 0 });
  const [size, setSize] = useState({ width: 100, height: 100 });

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleWindowMouseMove(e) {
      setPosition({ left: e.pageX, top: e.pageY });
    }
    // ...
```

Separating independent state variables also has another benefit. It makes it easy to later extract some related logic into a custom Hook, for example:

```js{2,7}
function Box() {
  const position = useWindowPosition();
  const [size, setSize] = useState({ width: 100, height: 100 });
  // ...
}

function useWindowPosition() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ left: 0, top: 0 });
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, []);
  return position;
}
```

Note how we were able to move the `useState` call for the `position` state variable and the related effect into a custom Hook without changing their code. If all state was in a single object, extracting it would be more difficult.

Both putting all state in a single `useState` call, and having a `useState` call per each field can work. Components tend to be most readable when you find a balance between these two extremes, and group related state into a few independent state variables. If the state logic becomes complex, we recommend [managing it with a reducer](/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) or a custom Hook.

### Can I run an effect only on updates? {#can-i-run-an-effect-only-on-updates}

This is a rare use case. If you need it, you can [use a mutable ref](#is-there-something-like-instance-variables) to manually store a boolean value corresponding to whether you are on the first or a subsequent render, then check that flag in your effect. (If you find yourself doing this often, you could create a custom Hook for it.)

### How to get the previous props or state? {#how-to-get-the-previous-props-or-state}

Currently, you can do it manually [with a ref](#is-there-something-like-instance-variables):

```js{6,8}
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const prevCountRef = useRef();
  useEffect(() => {
    prevCountRef.current = count;
  });
  const prevCount = prevCountRef.current;

  return <h1>Now: {count}, before: {prevCount}</h1>;
}
```

This might be a bit convoluted but you can extract it into a custom Hook:

```js{3,7}
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const prevCount = usePrevious(count);
  return <h1>Now: {count}, before: {prevCount}</h1>;
}

function usePrevious(value) {
  const ref = useRef();
  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current = value;
  });
  return ref.current;
}
```

Note how this would work for props, state, or any other calculated value.

```js{5}
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const calculation = count * 100;
  const prevCalculation = usePrevious(calculation);
  // ...
```

It's possible that in the future React will provide a `usePrevious` Hook out of the box since it's a relatively common use case.

See also [the recommended pattern for derived state](#how-do-i-implement-getderivedstatefromprops).

### Why am I seeing stale props or state inside my function? {#why-am-i-seeing-stale-props-or-state-inside-my-function}

Any function inside a component, including event handlers and effects, "sees" the props and state from the render it was created in. For example, consider code like this:

```js
function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleAlertClick() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      alert('You clicked on: ' + count);
    }, 3000);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
      <button onClick={handleAlertClick}>
        Show alert
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

If you first click "Show alert" and then increment the counter, the alert will show the `count` variable **at the time you clicked the "Show alert" button**. This prevents bugs caused by the code assuming props and state don't change.

If you intentionally want to read the *latest* state from some asynchronous callback, you could keep it in [a ref](/docs/hooks-faq.html#is-there-something-like-instance-variables), mutate it, and read from it.

Finally, another possible reason you're seeing stale props or state is if you use the "dependency array" optimization but didn't correctly specify all the dependencies. For example, if an effect specifies `[]` as the second argument but reads `someProp` inside, it will keep "seeing" the initial value of `someProp`. The solution is to either remove the dependency array, or to fix it. Here's [how you can deal with functions](#is-it-safe-to-omit-functions-from-the-list-of-dependencies), and here's [other common strategies](#what-can-i-do-if-my-effect-dependencies-change-too-often) to run effects less often without incorrectly skipping dependencies.

>Note
>
>We provide an [`exhaustive-deps`](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14920) ESLint rule as a part of the [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks#installation) package. It warns when dependencies are specified incorrectly and suggests a fix.

### How do I implement `getDerivedStateFromProps`? {#how-do-i-implement-getderivedstatefromprops}

While you probably [don't need it](/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html), in rare cases that you do (such as implementing a `<Transition>` component), you can update the state right during rendering. React will re-run the component with updated state immediately after exiting the first render so it wouldn't be expensive.

Here, we store the previous value of the `row` prop in a state variable so that we can compare:

```js
function ScrollView({row}) {
  let [isScrollingDown, setIsScrollingDown] = useState(false);
  let [prevRow, setPrevRow] = useState(null);

  if (row !== prevRow) {
    // Row changed since last render. Update isScrollingDown.
    setIsScrollingDown(prevRow !== null && row > prevRow);
    setPrevRow(row);
  }

  return `Scrolling down: ${isScrollingDown}`;
}
```

This might look strange at first, but an update during rendering is exactly what `getDerivedStateFromProps` has always been like conceptually.

### Is there something like forceUpdate? {#is-there-something-like-forceupdate}

Both `useState` and `useReducer` Hooks [bail out of updates](/docs/hooks-reference.html#bailing-out-of-a-state-update) if the next value is the same as the previous one. Mutating state in place and calling `setState` will not cause a re-render.

Normally, you shouldn't mutate local state in React. However, as an escape hatch, you can use an incrementing counter to force a re-render even if the state has not changed:

```js
  const [ignored, forceUpdate] = useReducer(x => x + 1, 0);

  function handleClick() {
    forceUpdate();
  }
```

Try to avoid this pattern if possible.

### Can I make a ref to a function component? {#can-i-make-a-ref-to-a-function-component}

While you shouldn't need this often, you may expose some imperative methods to a parent component with the [`useImperativeHandle`](/docs/hooks-reference.html#useimperativehandle) Hook.

### How can I measure a DOM node? {#how-can-i-measure-a-dom-node}

In order to measure the position or size of a DOM node, you can use a [callback ref](/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#callback-refs). React will call that callback whenever the ref gets attached to a different node. Here is a [small demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/l7m0v5x4v9):

```js{4-8,12}
function MeasureExample() {
  const [height, setHeight] = useState(0);

  const measuredRef = useCallback(node => {
    if (node !== null) {
      setHeight(node.getBoundingClientRect().height);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <h1 ref={measuredRef}>Hello, world</h1>
      <h2>The above header is {Math.round(height)}px tall</h2>
    </>
  );
}
```

We didn't choose `useRef` in this example because an object ref doesn't notify us about *changes* to the current ref value. Using a callback ref ensures that [even if a child component displays the measured node later](https://codesandbox.io/s/818zzk8m78) (e.g. in response to a click), we still get notified about it in the parent component and can update the measurements.

Note that we pass `[]` as a dependency array to `useCallback`. This ensures that our ref callback doesn't change between the re-renders, and so React won't call it unnecessarily.

If you want, you can [extract this logic](https://codesandbox.io/s/m5o42082xy) into a reusable Hook:

```js{2}
function MeasureExample() {
  const [rect, ref] = useClientRect();
  return (
    <>
      <h1 ref={ref}>Hello, world</h1>
      {rect !== null &&
        <h2>The above header is {Math.round(rect.height)}px tall</h2>
      }
    </>
  );
}

function useClientRect() {
  const [rect, setRect] = useState(null);
  const ref = useCallback(node => {
    if (node !== null) {
      setRect(node.getBoundingClientRect());
    }
  }, []);
  return [rect, ref];
}
```


### What does `const [thing, setThing] = useState()` mean? {#what-does-const-thing-setthing--usestate-mean}

If you're not familiar with this syntax, check out the [explanation](/docs/hooks-state.html#tip-what-do-square-brackets-mean) in the State Hook documentation.


## Performance Optimizations {#performance-optimizations}

### Can I skip an effect on updates? {#can-i-skip-an-effect-on-updates}

Yes. See [conditionally firing an effect](/docs/hooks-reference.html#conditionally-firing-an-effect). Note that forgetting to handle updates often [introduces bugs](/docs/hooks-effect.html#explanation-why-effects-run-on-each-update), which is why this isn't the default behavior.

### Is it safe to omit functions from the list of dependencies? {#is-it-safe-to-omit-functions-from-the-list-of-dependencies}

Generally speaking, no.

```js{3,8}
function Example({ someProp }) {
  function doSomething() {
    console.log(someProp);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    doSomething();
  }, []); // 🔴 This is not safe (it calls `doSomething` which uses `someProp`)
}
```

It's difficult to remember which props or state are used by functions outside of the effect. This is why **usually you'll want to declare functions needed by an effect *inside* of it.** Then it's easy to see what values from the component scope that effect depends on:

```js{4,8}
function Example({ someProp }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    function doSomething() {
      console.log(someProp);
    }

    doSomething();
  }, [someProp]); // ✅ OK (our effect only uses `someProp`)
}
```

If after that we still don't use any values from the component scope, it's safe to specify `[]`:

```js{7}
useEffect(() => {
  function doSomething() {
    console.log('hello');
  }

  doSomething();
}, []); // ✅ OK in this example because we don't use *any* values from component scope
```

Depending on your use case, there are a few more options described below.

Let's see why this matters.

If you specify a [list of dependencies](/docs/hooks-reference.html#conditionally-firing-an-effect) as the last argument to `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or `useImperativeHandle`, it must include all values used inside that participate in the React data flow. That includes props, state, and anything derived from them.  

It is **only** safe to omit a function from the dependency list if nothing in it (or the functions called by it) references props, state, or values derived from them. This example has a bug:

```js{5,12}
function ProductPage({ productId }) {
  const [product, setProduct] = useState(null);

  async function fetchProduct() {
    const response = await fetch('http://myapi/product' + productId); // Uses productId prop
    const json = await response.json();
    setProduct(json);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProduct();
  }, []); // 🔴 Invalid because `fetchProduct` uses `productId`
  // ...
}
```

**The recommended fix is to move that function _inside_ of your effect**. That makes it easy to see which props or state your effect uses, and to ensure they're all declared:

```js{5-10,13}
function ProductPage({ productId }) {
  const [product, setProduct] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // By moving this function inside the effect, we can clearly see the values it uses.
    async function fetchProduct() {
      const response = await fetch('http://myapi/product' + productId);
      const json = await response.json();
      setProduct(json);
    }

    fetchProduct();
  }, [productId]); // ✅ Valid because our effect only uses productId
  // ...
}
```

This also allows you to handle out-of-order responses with a local variable inside the effect:

```js{2,6,8}
  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    async function fetchProduct() {
      const response = await fetch('http://myapi/product/' + productId);
      const json = await response.json();
      if (!ignore) setProduct(json);
    }
    return () => { ignore = true };
  }, [productId]);
```

We moved the function inside the effect so it doesn't need to be in its dependency list.

>Tip

>Check out [this small demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/jvvkoo8pq3) and [this article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data/) to learn more about data fetching with Hooks.

**If for some reason you _can't_ move a function inside an effect, there are a few more options:**

* **You can try moving that function outside of your component**. In that case, the function is guaranteed to not reference any props or state, and also doesn't need to be in the list of dependencies.
* If the function you're calling is a pure computation and is safe to call while rendering, you may **call it outside of the effect instead,** and make the effect depend on the returned value.
* As a last resort, you can **add a function to effect dependencies but _wrap its definition_** into the [`useCallback`](/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback) Hook. This ensures it doesn't change on every render unless *its own* dependencies also change:

```js{2-5}
function ProductPage({ productId }) {
  // ✅ Wrap with useCallback to avoid change on every render
  const fetchProduct = useCallback(() => {
    // ... Does something with productId ...
  }, [productId]); // ✅ All useCallback dependencies are specified

  return <ProductDetails fetchProduct={fetchProduct} />;
}

function ProductDetails({ fetchProduct })
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProduct();
  }, [fetchProduct]); // ✅ All useEffect dependencies are specified
  // ...
}
```

Note that in the above example we **need** to keep the function in the dependencies list. This ensures that a change in the `productId` prop of `ProductPage` automatically triggers a refetch in the `ProductDetails` component.

### What can I do if my effect dependencies change too often?

Sometimes, your effect may be using reading state that changes too often. You might be tempted to omit that state from a list of dependencies, but that usually leads to bugs:

```js{6,9}
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(count + 1); // This effect depends on the `count` state
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []); // 🔴 Bug: `count` is not specified as a dependency

  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
}
```

Specifying `[count]` as a list of dependencies would fix the bug, but would cause the interval to be reset on every change. That may not be desirable. To fix this, we can use the [functional update form of `setState`](/docs/hooks-reference.html#functional-updates). It lets us specify *how* the state needs to change without referencing the *current* state:

```js{6,9}
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + 1); // ✅ This doesn't depend on `count` variable outside
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []); // ✅ Our effect doesn't use any variables in the component scope

  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
}
```

(The identity of the `setCount` function is guaranteed to be stable so it's safe to omit.)

In more complex cases (such as if one state depends on another state), try moving the state update logic outside the effect with the [`useReducer` Hook](/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer). [This article](https://adamrackis.dev/state-and-use-reducer/) offers an example of how you can do this. **The identity of the `dispatch` function from `useReducer` is always stable** — even if the reducer function is declared inside the component and reads its props.

As a last resort, if you want to something like `this` in a class, you can [use a ref](/docs/hooks-faq.html#is-there-something-like-instance-variables) to hold a mutable variable. Then you can write and read to it. For example:

```js{2-6,10-11,16}
function Example(props) {
  // Keep latest props in a ref.
  let latestProps = useRef(props);
  useEffect(() => {
    latestProps.current = props;
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    function tick() {
      // Read latest props at any time
      console.log(latestProps.current);
    }

    const id = setInterval(tick, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []); // This effect never re-runs
}
```

Only do this if you couldn't find a better alternative, as relying on mutation makes components less predictable. If there's a specific pattern that doesn't translate well, [file an issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/new) with a runnable example code and we can try to help.

### How do I implement `shouldComponentUpdate`? {#how-do-i-implement-shouldcomponentupdate}

You can wrap a function component with `React.memo` to shallowly compare its props:

```js
const Button = React.memo((props) => {
  // your component
});
```

It's not a Hook because it doesn't compose like Hooks do. `React.memo` is equivalent to `PureComponent`, but it only compares props. (You can also add a second argument to specify a custom comparison function that takes the old and new props. If it returns true, the update is skipped.)

`React.memo` doesn't compare state because there is no single state object to compare. But you can make children pure too, or even [optimize individual children with `useMemo`](/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-memoize-calculations).

### How to memoize calculations? {#how-to-memoize-calculations}

The [`useMemo`](/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo) Hook lets you cache calculations between multiple renders by "remembering" the previous computation:

```js
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

This code calls `computeExpensiveValue(a, b)`. But if the inputs `[a, b]` haven't changed since the last value, `useMemo` skips calling it a second time and simply reuses the last value it returned.

Remember that the function passed to `useMemo` runs during rendering. Don't do anything there that you wouldn't normally do while rendering. For example, side effects belong in `useEffect`, not `useMemo`.

**You may rely on `useMemo` as a performance optimization, not as a semantic guarantee.** In the future, React may choose to "forget" some previously memoized values and recalculate them on next render, e.g. to free memory for offscreen components. Write your code so that it still works without `useMemo` — and then add it to optimize performance. (For rare cases when a value must *never* be recomputed, you can [lazily initialize](#how-to-create-expensive-objects-lazily) a ref.)

Conveniently, `useMemo` also lets you skip an expensive re-render of a child:

```js
function Parent({ a, b }) {
  // Only re-rendered if `a` changes:
  const child1 = useMemo(() => <Child1 a={a} />, [a]);
  // Only re-rendered if `b` changes:
  const child2 = useMemo(() => <Child2 b={b} />, [b]);
  return (
    <>
      {child1}
      {child2}
    </>
  )
}
```

Note that this approach won't work in a loop because Hook calls [can't](/docs/hooks-rules.html) be placed inside loops. But you can extract a separate component for the list item, and call `useMemo` there.

### How to create expensive objects lazily? {#how-to-create-expensive-objects-lazily}

`useMemo` lets you [memoize an expensive calculation](#how-to-memoize-calculations) if the inputs are the same. However, it only serves as a hint, and doesn't *guarantee* the computation won't re-run. But sometimes you need to be sure an object is only created once.

**The first common use case is when creating the initial state is expensive:**

```js
function Table(props) {
  // ⚠️ createRows() is called on every render
  const [rows, setRows] = useState(createRows(props.count));
  // ...
}
```

To avoid re-creating the ignored initial state, we can pass a **function** to `useState`:

```js
function Table(props) {
  // ✅ createRows() is only called once
  const [rows, setRows] = useState(() => createRows(props.count));
  // ...
}
```

React will only call this function during the first render. See the [`useState` API reference](/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate).

**You might also occasionally want to avoid re-creating the `useRef()` initial value.** For example, maybe you want to ensure some imperative class instance only gets created once:

```js
function Image(props) {
  // ⚠️ IntersectionObserver is created on every render
  const ref = useRef(new IntersectionObserver(onIntersect));
  // ...
}
```

`useRef` **does not** accept a special function overload like `useState`. Instead, you can write your own function that creates and sets it lazily:

```js
function Image(props) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  // ✅ IntersectionObserver is created lazily once
  function getObserver() {
    let observer = ref.current;
    if (observer !== null) {
      return observer;
    }
    let newObserver = new IntersectionObserver(onIntersect);
    ref.current = newObserver;
    return newObserver;
  }

  // When you need it, call getObserver()
  // ...
}
```

This avoids creating an expensive object until it's truly needed for the first time. If you use Flow or TypeScript, you can also give `getObserver()` a non-nullable type for convenience.


### Are Hooks slow because of creating functions in render? {#are-hooks-slow-because-of-creating-functions-in-render}

No. In modern browsers, the raw performance of closures compared to classes doesn't differ significantly except in extreme scenarios.

In addition, consider that the design of Hooks is more efficient in a couple ways:

* Hooks avoid a lot of the overhead that classes require, like the cost of creating class instances and binding event handlers in the constructor.

* **Idiomatic code using Hooks doesn't need the deep component tree nesting** that is prevalent in codebases that use higher-order components, render props, and context. With smaller component trees, React has less work to do.

Traditionally, performance concerns around inline functions in React have been related to how passing new callbacks on each render breaks `shouldComponentUpdate` optimizations in child components. Hooks approach this problem from three sides.

* The [`useCallback`](/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback) Hook lets you keep the same callback reference between re-renders so that `shouldComponentUpdate` continues to work:

    ```js{2}
    // Will not change unless `a` or `b` changes
    const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
      doSomething(a, b);
    }, [a, b]);
    ```

* The [`useMemo` Hook](/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-memoize-calculations) makes it easier to control when individual children update, reducing the need for pure components.

* Finally, the `useReducer` Hook reduces the need to pass callbacks deeply, as explained below.

### How to avoid passing callbacks down? {#how-to-avoid-passing-callbacks-down}

We've found that most people don't enjoy manually passing callbacks through every level of a component tree. Even though it is more explicit, it can feel like a lot of "plumbing".

In large component trees, an alternative we recommend is to pass down a `dispatch` function from [`useReducer`](/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) via context:

```js{4,5}
const TodosDispatch = React.createContext(null);

function TodosApp() {
  // Note: `dispatch` won't change between re-renders
  const [todos, dispatch] = useReducer(todosReducer);

  return (
    <TodosDispatch.Provider value={dispatch}>
      <DeepTree todos={todos} />
    </TodosDispatch.Provider>
  );
}
```

Any child in the tree inside `TodosApp` can use the `dispatch` function to pass actions up to `TodosApp`:

```js{2,3}
function DeepChild(props) {
  // If we want to perform an action, we can get dispatch from context.
  const dispatch = useContext(TodosDispatch);

  function handleClick() {
    dispatch({ type: 'add', text: 'hello' });
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Add todo</button>
  );
}
```

This is both more convenient from the maintenance perspective (no need to keep forwarding callbacks), and avoids the callback problem altogether. Passing `dispatch` down like this is the recommended pattern for deep updates.

Note that you can still choose whether to pass the application *state* down as props (more explicit) or as context (more convenient for very deep updates). If you use context to pass down the state too, use two different context types -- the `dispatch` context never changes, so components that read it don't need to rerender unless they also need the application state.

### How to read an often-changing value from `useCallback`? {#how-to-read-an-often-changing-value-from-usecallback}

>Note
>
>We recommend to [pass `dispatch` down in context](#how-to-avoid-passing-callbacks-down) rather than individual callbacks in props. The approach below is only mentioned here for completeness and as an escape hatch.
>
>Also note that this pattern might cause problems in the [concurrent mode](/blog/2018/03/27/update-on-async-rendering.html). We plan to provide more ergonomic alternatives in the future, but the safest solution right now is to always invalidate the callback if some value it depends on changes.

In some rare cases you might need to memoize a callback with [`useCallback`](/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback) but the memoization doesn't work very well because the inner function has to be re-created too often. If the function you're memoizing is an event handler and isn't used during rendering, you can use [ref as an instance variable](#is-there-something-like-instance-variables), and save the last committed value into it manually:

```js{6,10}
function Form() {
  const [text, updateText] = useState('');
  const textRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    textRef.current = text; // Write it to the ref
  });

  const handleSubmit = useCallback(() => {
    const currentText = textRef.current; // Read it from the ref
    alert(currentText);
  }, [textRef]); // Don't recreate handleSubmit like [text] would do

  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => updateText(e.target.value)} />
      <ExpensiveTree onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
    </>
  );
}
```

This is a rather convoluted pattern but it shows that you can do this escape hatch optimization if you need it. It's more bearable if you extract it to a custom Hook:

```js{4,16}
function Form() {
  const [text, updateText] = useState('');
  // Will be memoized even if `text` changes:
  const handleSubmit = useEventCallback(() => {
    alert(text);
  }, [text]);

  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => updateText(e.target.value)} />
      <ExpensiveTree onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
    </>
  );
}

function useEventCallback(fn, dependencies) {
  const ref = useRef(() => {
    throw new Error('Cannot call an event handler while rendering.');
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current = fn;
  }, [fn, ...dependencies]);

  return useCallback(() => {
    const fn = ref.current;
    return fn();
  }, [ref]);
}
```

In either case, we **don't recommend this pattern** and only show it here for completeness. Instead, it is preferable to [avoid passing callbacks deep down](#how-to-avoid-passing-callbacks-down).


## Under the Hood {#under-the-hood}

### How does React associate Hook calls with components? {#how-does-react-associate-hook-calls-with-components}

React keeps track of the currently rendering component. Thanks to the [Rules of Hooks](/docs/hooks-rules.html), we know that Hooks are only called from React components (or custom Hooks -- which are also only called from React components).

There is an internal list of "memory cells" associated with each component. They're just JavaScript objects where we can put some data. When you call a Hook like `useState()`, it reads the current cell (or initializes it during the first render), and then moves the pointer to the next one. This is how multiple `useState()` calls each get independent local state.

### What is the prior art for Hooks? {#what-is-the-prior-art-for-hooks}

Hooks synthesize ideas from several different sources:

* Our old experiments with functional APIs in the [react-future](https://github.com/reactjs/react-future/tree/master/07%20-%20Returning%20State) repository.
* React community's experiments with render prop APIs, including [Ryan Florence](https://github.com/ryanflorence)'s [Reactions Component](https://github.com/reactions/component).
* [Dominic Gannaway](https://github.com/trueadm)'s [`adopt` keyword](https://gist.github.com/trueadm/17beb64288e30192f3aa29cad0218067) proposal as a sugar syntax for render props.
* State variables and state cells in [DisplayScript](http://displayscript.org/introduction.html).
* [Reducer components](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/state-actions-reducer.html) in ReasonReact.
* [Subscriptions](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/class/es6/Subscription.js~Subscription.html) in Rx.
* [Algebraic effects](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-effects-tutorial#2-effectful-computations-in-a-pure-setting) in Multicore OCaml.

[Sebastian Markbåge](https://github.com/sebmarkbage) came up with the original design for Hooks, later refined by [Andrew Clark](https://github.com/acdlite), [Sophie Alpert](https://github.com/sophiebits), [Dominic Gannaway](https://github.com/trueadm), and other members of the React team.
